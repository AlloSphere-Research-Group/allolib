/**
 * @brief The SynthRecorder class records the events arriving at a PolySynth
 *
 * @ingroup Scene
 *
 * Events are stored in a text file that looks like:
 *
 * @code
 * + 0 72 SineEnv 6.5 523.251 0.5 0.2 1 0
 * + 0.149975 74 SineEnv 6.5 587.33 0.5 0.2 1 0
 * - 0.183213 72
 * + 0.283204 76 SineEnv 6.5 659.255 0.5 0.2 1 0
 * - 0.366428 74
 * - 0.483025 76
 * @endcode
 *
 * The '+' command triggers the start of an event and the '-' command triggers
 * the end of the event. The first number after the command is the time at
 * which it should happen and the second one is the id of the event, used to
 * connect the 'trigger off' to a previous 'trigger on'.
 *
 * Alternatively, the sequence can be recorded in CPP_FORMAT that produces C++
 * code that can be pasted to deliver the sequence.
 *
 * The sequences stored in the text file can be played back using SynthSequencer
 * You must make sre that the synthesizers referenced in the sequence have
 * enough allocated polyphony for the whole sequence or alternatively that
 * the class has been registered to the PolySynth using registerSynthClass().
 *
 * @code
 * SynthSequencer seq;
 * // Pre allocate voices
 * seq.synth().allocatePolyphony<SineEnv>(64);
 * // Register class with PolySynth
 * seq.synth().registerSynthClass<SineEnv>("SineEnv");
 * @endcode
 *
