 * @brief Event Sequencer triggering audio visual "notes"

 * Sequences can be created programatically:
 * @code
    SynthSequencer seq;
    seq.add<SineEnv>( 0  ).set(3.5, 260, 0.3, .011, .2);
    seq.add<SineEnv>( 0  ).set(3.5, 510, 0.3, .011, .2);
    seq.add<SineEnv>( 3.5).set(3.5, 233, 0.3, .011, .2);
    seq.add<SineEnv>( 3.5).set(3.5, 340, 0.3, .011, .2);
    seq.add<SineEnv>( 3.5).set(7.5, 710, 0.3, 1, 2);
 *  @endcode
 *
 * The render() functions need to be places within their relevant contexts like
 * the audio callback (e.g. onSound() ) or the graphics callback (e.g. onDraw())
 *
 * A time master can be selected in the constructor to define where the
 * sequencer runs. TimeMasterMode::TIME_MASTER_AUDIO is more precise in time,
 but you might want
 * to use TIME_MASTER_GRAPHICS if your "note" produces no audio.
 *
 * Sequences can also be read from text files with the extension
 * ".synthSequence". You need to register the voices used in the sequence
 * with the PolySynth using this->synth().registerSynthClass<MyVoice>("MyVoice")
 * to connect the voice name in the text file to a class name.
 *
 * The following commands are accepted:
 *
 * Event
 * @ absTime duration synthName pFields....
 *
 * e.g. @ 0.981379 0.116669 MyVoice 0 0 1 698.456 0.1 1
 *
 * Turnon
 * + absTime eventId synthName pFields....
 *
 * e.g. + 0.981379 25 MyVoice 0 0 1 698.456 0.1 1
 *
 * Turnoff
 * - absTime eventId
 *
 * eventId looks of the oldest id match adn turns it off
 * e.g. - 1.3 25
 *
 * Tempo
 * t absTime tempoBpm
 *
 * e.g. t 4.5 120
 *
 * Insert another sequence
 * = absTime sequenceName timeScale
 *
 * e.g. = 201.0000 "endEtherial.synthSequence" 1
 *
 * Time offset
 * > timeOffset
 *
 * All events following will have this offset added to their start time.
 Negative numbers are allowed.
